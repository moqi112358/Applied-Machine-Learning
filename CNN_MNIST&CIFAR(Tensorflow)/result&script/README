#Environment: python3.5, tensorflow 1.1

Here is two folds.

mnist: Include the result and script for Question 1.
	mnist/problem1:  The model used in the tensorboard tutorial 
	mnist/problem2:  The model used in the "DEEP MNIST for experts" tutorial 
	mnist/advanced:  Motified the model in problem2
In each fold, it includes: 
	acc.txt: the training and test accuracy
	HW8_mnist.py: train the CNN model
	draw_convnet.py: create the graph of CNN model

cifar: Include the result and script for Question 2.
	cifar/problem1:  The model used in the tutorial 
	cifar/advanced:  Motified the model in problem1
In each fold, it includes: 
	train.txt: the training accuracy
	eval.txt: the training test accuracy
	cifar10.py: create the CNN model
	cifar10_train.py: run the training part
	cifar10_eval.py: run the evaluating part
	cifar10_input.py: data input
	draw_convnet.py: create the graph of CNN model
	#You should run the cifar10_train.py and cifar10_eval.py at the same time.
